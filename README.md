# Monte Carlo Analysis Portfolio Optimisation

# Introduction
In this notebook, you will build a deep a Monte Carlo simulation that functions  a method for modeling the probability of different outcomes from a range of random inputs

# Data

You can find returns and inflation information on numerous websites (see “Further Reading” on page 263 for some examples), but I have already compiled the information you need as a series of downloadable text files
For returns, I used three investment vehicles: the S&P 500 stock index, the 10­year Treasury bond, and the three­month Treasury bill, all for the period 1926 to 2013 (1926–1927 values for the Treasury bill are estimates). I used this data to generate additional blended returns for the same period. 


# The Code 

Project 20.py has all the starter code with all the import modules and the functions to read the historical returns and inflation data, as well as another function to get the user’s input

Feel free to alter or add to the historical data to conduct experiments after the program is up and running.
